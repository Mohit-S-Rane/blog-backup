# 🎭 Project 2: Persona-Based Prompting with LLMs – Become Hitesh or Piyush (Kind Of)

Imagine you're chatting with a chatbot, and it suddenly starts replying *exactly* like your favorite tech YouTuber—cracking jokes, throwing in real-developer sarcasm, and dishing out advice like it's a weekend live stream. That’s not magic—it’s **persona-based prompting**.

In this blog, I’ll walk you through **Project 2** of our LLM series: creating a **custom AI persona** that responds like **Hitesh Choudhary** or **Piyush Garg**. Using **tone references** from their YouTube videos and tweets, we’ll teach an LLM not just to *answer*, but to answer with *personality*.

But before we impersonate internet legends, let’s dive into the **what, why, and how** of **prompt engineering**.

---

## 💡 What Is Prompt Engineering?

Prompting is basically how we "talk" to large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT or Claude. The better you design the prompt, the better and more controlled the output.

At its core, it’s like giving instructions to a super-smart intern who knows *everything*—but needs very clear direction.

> Think of LLMs as improv actors—they need a setting, a character, and some lines to get going. That’s prompting.

## 🎯 Why Prompting Matters (Especially for Personas)

If you ask an LLM “What is JavaScript?” you’ll get a generic, textbook answer.

But if you prompt it to **“Answer like Hitesh Choudhary explaining to first-year college students”**, suddenly it feels *alive*:

> "JavaScript is that one language people love to hate but still can’t live without. It runs in your browser, and yes, it’s quirky. But once you get past the 'undefined is not a function' phase, you’ll fall in love. Promise."
> 

Cool, right?

To make this happen, let’s understand the **10 major prompting techniques**—each like a weapon in your LLM toolkit.

---

## 🧪 1. Zero-shot Prompting

This is the "cold start." You give no examples—just the instruction.

```
"Explain recursion like Hitesh Choudhary would."

```

Works great when the model already has context (like famous personas). But it may lack nuance.

---

## 🧪 2. Few-shot Prompting

Here, you provide a few examples to guide the tone.

```
Input: "What is a loop?"
Output: "A loop is like that annoying friend who keeps calling you until you answer. It runs until a condition is met—or you break it."

Input: "What is a function?"
Output: "A function is your code's lazy assistant. Give it some input, and it does the job for you."

→ Then, ask about "recursion" and get a reply in similar tone.

```

This improves control and mimics humor, sarcasm, or empathy.

---

## 🧠 3. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting

Let the model **think out loud**. Useful for reasoning tasks.

```
"Explain this to me step by step like Piyush Garg debugging a startup issue."

```

> "Okay, first things first—check the logs. No logs? Check if the logger is even working. Still nothing? Well, now it's time to panic."
> 

You get more than an answer—you get the *thought process*.

---

## 🔁 4. Self-Consistency Prompting

Instead of one output, generate multiple and choose the best or most common.

Use case:

> Prompt 5 responses for the same question in Hitesh-style, then vote or filter.
> 

This helps avoid randomness and enhances reliability—especially useful when the tone varies.

---

## 🧾 5. Instruction Prompting

Straightforward: Give clear instructions.

```
"Act as Hitesh Choudhary. Use casual language, short sentences, and use examples from real life. Explain ‘Promises in JavaScript’."

```

LLMs love specificity. It’s like telling your delivery app “no onions, medium spicy.”

---

## 🎯 6. Direct Answer Prompting

Want just the answer? Ask like this:

```
"In 10 words or less, explain how closures work, like Piyush Garg would."

```

No fluff. Just snappy, punchy replies.

---

## 🧑‍🎤 7. Persona-Based Prompting (The Star of This Blog)

Here’s where we **become Hitesh or Piyush**.

### Step 1: Gather Tone Samples

- Watch YouTube sessions, especially the unfiltered Q&A or live debugging.
- Scrape or copy tweets—note sentence structure, emojis, catchphrases, and tone.

> Hitesh: Conversational, motivational, honest. Uses metaphors (“Coding is like building muscles.”)
> 
> 
> Piyush: Practical, witty, developer-to-developer, no-BS tone.
> 

### Step 2: Craft the Persona Prompt

```
"You are Hitesh Choudhary. You speak in Hindi-English mix. You motivate learners. You joke about bugs and love VS Code. When asked technical questions, explain with analogies."

```

or

```
"You are Piyush Garg. You love startups, clean code, and fast deploys. Your tone is blunt but helpful. Keep answers real and avoid sugarcoating."

```

Then test it:

```
“What’s the difference between var, let, and const?”

```

And boom—you’ve got replies that *feel like the real person*.

---

## 🎭 8. Role-Playing Prompting

Push it further:

```
"You are Piyush Garg giving a live session to interns. Someone asks about async/await. Respond like you're on a Discord call."

```

Now the LLM is not just in character—it’s in *context*.

> You can even switch personas mid-conversation:
> 
> 
> “Now Hitesh interrupts and gives his version.”
> 

---

## 🧠 9. Contextual Prompting

Provide **background context** to improve relevance.

```
"You’re explaining to second-year CS students who just learned loops. Use relatable examples and assume they know basic JS."

```

This avoids repeating basics or overwhelming the user.

---

## 🧰 10. Multimodal Prompting

Future-ready stuff! Combine **text + images + audio** (in tools like GPT-4 Vision or Gemini).

Imagine:

- Showing a code snippet
- Asking: “How would Hitesh Choudhary explain this diagram in a YouTube video?”

Multimodal prompting makes LLMs feel like true teachers—not just typists.
