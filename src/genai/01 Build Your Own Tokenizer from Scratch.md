# 🧠 Challenge 1: Build Your Own Tokenizer from Scratch

Have you ever tried teaching a machine to “read” Hindi or English? If so, you’ve probably realized it’s not as simple as splitting text at spaces. Welcome to the world of **tokenization**—the very first, yet incredibly powerful step in building intelligent language models.

In this blog, I’ll walk you through **Project 1: Writing a tokenizer from scratch** for both **Hindi and English**. We’ll explore what tokenization really means, how it ties into cutting-edge concepts like **transformers**, and why it matters in models like ChatGPT or BERT. Buckle up—this is where the real magic begins!

## 🪄 What Even Is a Tokenizer?

Let’s start simple. A tokenizer is like a language detective—it takes a sentence and **breaks it into manageable chunks**, called **tokens**. These tokens might be words, subwords, or even characters.

### For example:

> "I love samosas."
> 
> 
> becomes → ["I", "love", "samosas", "."]
> 

Seems easy, right? But…

### What about:

> "मैं समोसे पसंद करता हूँ।"
> 
> 
> Should it be:
> 
- ["मैं", "समोसे", "पसंद", "करता", "हूँ", "।"] or
- Character by character?

That’s your first challenge as a tokenizer creator: **deciding the rules** for breaking down language. And yes, those rules vary a lot between English and Hindi.

## 🤯 Why Is Tokenization a Big Deal?

In large language models like **transformers**, we don't feed raw sentences. Machines understand **numbers**, not words. Tokenization transforms text into a numerical form so that models can process it.

If you get tokenization wrong, **everything else breaks**—from embeddings to attention mechanisms.

## 🌐 Building a Tokenizer: English vs Hindi

Let’s break this into 2 parts:

### 🔤 English Tokenizer

English is space-separated and doesn’t have complex ligatures.

A basic tokenizer can:

1. **Lowercase** everything.
2. **Remove punctuation** or split punctuation as tokens.
3. Use regex like:
    
    ```python
    import re
    tokens = re.findall(r"\b\w+\b", text.lower())
    
    ```
    

But don’t stop there—try:

- Splitting contractions (`don’t` → `do` + `n’t`)
- Handling named entities

---

### 🪔 Hindi Tokenizer

Hindi (Devanagari) presents unique challenges:

- Complex **ligatures** (e.g., क्र, ज्ञ)
- **Compound words** (e.g., "सूर्यास्त")
- Lack of whitespace between components in some contexts

A simple character-level tokenizer is a good start:

```python
tokens = list(hindi_text)

```

But for real value:

- Use **Unicode categories** to separate consonants, matras, and punctuation.
- Consider a rule-based approach or dictionary-based breaking.

> 🧠 Fun Fact: Unicode assigns a unique code point to each Hindi character. This helps build language-agnostic tokenizers.

## 🧠 Connecting to Transformers

Now here’s where it gets cool. All that tokenization effort? It’s what feeds the **encoder-decoder architecture** of transformers.

### 🌱 Transformers in Brief:

- **Encoder** reads and understands the input (tokenized text).
- **Decoder** generates predictions (like translated text or next word).
- Tokenization is what makes this possible—**it feeds the input as vectors**.

### Flowchart:

```
Raw Text → Tokenizer → Tokens → Embeddings → Encoder/Decoder → Output

```

Without proper tokenization, even the mighty transformer is just... confused.

## 🧬 Token → Embedding → Vector

Each token is converted to a **vector**—a list of numbers that carries meaning.

These are learned representations:

- "king" might be [0.45, 1.3, -0.9...]
- "queen" might be close by in vector space!

This is the magic of **embeddings**—they capture **semantic meaning** (relatedness) between words. Hindi synonyms like "खुशी" and "आनंद" would ideally be close in vector space too.

## 🌀 Positional Encoding: Knowing Word Order

Unlike RNNs, transformers don’t process tokens sequentially. So how do they understand **order**?

They use **positional encodings**—mathematical patterns added to embeddings to encode sequence. It's like tagging each word with its place in the sentence.

```
"I am happy" → [Token1 + Pos1, Token2 + Pos2, Token3 + Pos3]

```

Without this, "I am happy" and "happy am I" would look the same!

---

## 🔍 Self-Attention: The Brain of Transformers

Ever wondered how transformers “know” which words to focus on? That's thanks to **self-attention**.

- Each token looks at other tokens to decide what's important.
- For instance, in "He fed the dog because it was hungry", what does “it” refer to?
    
    Self-attention helps figure that out!
    

This attention gets visualized via **attention heads**, and we usually use **multi-head attention** to allow parallel understanding of relationships.

---

## 🔢 Vocab Size & Softmax

When creating your tokenizer, you’ll define a **vocabulary**—a fixed set of known tokens (say 30,000 or 50,000). Each token maps to an ID.

Why limit vocab size?

- Smaller vocab → faster, but may miss nuances.
- Bigger vocab → accurate, but heavier on memory.

Once a model generates token scores, we apply **softmax** to convert raw scores to probabilities. The token with the highest probability wins!

> 🎛️ Tip: Tweak temperature in softmax to make outputs more creative (higher = more diverse; lower = more deterministic).
> 

---

## 🚧 Knowledge Cutoff

Your tokenizer doesn’t know what it doesn’t know. Every model has a **knowledge cutoff**—the latest point in time it was trained on.

As a tokenizer builder, you decide:

- What data to feed it
- How frequently to update it
- How to handle **Out of Vocabulary (OOV)** words

For Hindi, this might mean recognizing new slang or hybrid words like “वर्कफ्रॉमहोम”.

---

## 🧪 So... What’s the Challenge?

Your challenge is to build:

- A tokenizer that works for both Hindi and English
- Handles punctuation, whitespace, ligatures, and special symbols
- Outputs token lists ready for embedding and feeding into transformers

> 💡 Bonus: Add custom rules for domain-specific language (e.g., medical terms or legal vocabulary).

## 🧠 Conclusion: You’re the Language Architect

Tokenization isn’t just “step 1”—it’s the **foundation of the entire NLP pipeline**. You’re not just building a script to split sentences—you’re designing how machines understand meaning itself.

Whether you’re handling elegant Devanagari scripts or English contractions, building a tokenizer from scratch will give you a deep appreciation for everything that happens **before** you even call `.fit()` on a model.
