# 🤖 Project 5: Building an LLM Router – Let the Right Model Handle the Right Job

> Imagine you're at a help desk with multiple experts — a coder, a writer, a translator, and a data scientist. You ask a question, and the front desk instantly knows who to forward it to.
> 
> 
> That’s exactly what **an LLM Router** does — but for large language models.
> 

In Project 5, we’re building a smart system that can take in a user's query and intelligently decide which **LLM model** should handle it, based on **capability**, **context**, and **cost-efficiency**. Sounds like AI hiring a team of other AIs, right?

Let’s unpack how this works.

---

## 🧠 What is an LLM Router?

Simply put, an **LLM Router** is a system that acts like an intelligent traffic controller.

> It reads your query and sends it to the best-suited model to handle the job — whether it’s OpenAI’s GPT, Cohere’s Command R, Anthropic’s Claude, or Mistral.
> 

It doesn’t just pick a model randomly. It makes decisions based on:

- 🧩 **Query Type** (Is it a coding task, a casual response, a long-form generation, etc.?)
- 🎯 **Model Capability** (Which model is trained for what?)
- 💸 **Cost Efficiency** (Why pay $0.12 when $0.004 gets the job done?)

---

## 🏗️ Why Build This?

In the real world, we often juggle multiple tools. You wouldn’t use Photoshop to crop a photo when Paint can do it, right?

Same goes for LLMs.

If you’re building apps that integrate AI—whether it’s a chatbot, assistant, or coding helper—then using the right model for the right task is:

- **Faster**
- **Cheaper**
- **More accurate**

So instead of relying on **one giant model for everything**, you design a **smart router** that:

1. Classifies the query
2. Evaluates available models
3. Sends the job to the best-fit model

---

## 🧩 Step 1: Pick 3–4 LLMs (Your “Model Pool”)

Let’s start by selecting the cast for our AI orchestra.

### 🧠 Example Model Pool:

| Model | Strength | Weakness | Price (per 1K tokens) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GPT-4-turbo (OpenAI) | Complex reasoning, long context, coding | Slower, expensive | ~$0.01–$0.03 |
| Mistral 7B (via Ollama) | Lightweight, runs locally, basic tasks | Weaker understanding | Free (offline) |
| Claude (Anthropic) | Long memory, great summarizer | Less “code-oriented” | ~$0.008–$0.024 |
| Command R+ (Cohere) | Fast & cheap RAG usage | Limited tone finesse | ~$0.002–$0.008 |

### ⚙️ Add Metadata:

You’ll store this info in a config file or dictionary, like:

```json
{
  "gpt-4-turbo": { "skills": ["code", "reasoning"], "cost": 0.02 },
  "mistral": { "skills": ["chat", "light tasks"], "cost": 0 },
  ...
}

```

This is your model metadata — the brain behind the router.

---

## 📥 Step 2: Classify the Incoming Query

Now, when a user types a query like:

> “Can you build me a Python function to fetch GitHub issues?”
> 

The system should recognize that this is:

- 🧠 A **coding task**
- 🛠️ Requires **tool-use or code generation**
- 💡 Best handled by **GPT-4** or **Command R+**

### 🧰 Techniques to Use:

- **Keyword detection** (basic)
- **Query embedding + similarity to intent categories** (advanced)
- **Prompt-based intent detection** using a cheap LLM

### 🔎 Example Categories:

| Category | Keywords | Ideal Models |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Coding Help | “function”, “script”, “API” | GPT-4, Command R+ |
| Casual Chat | “tell me”, “joke”, “how are you” | Mistral |
| Summarization | “summarize”, “TLDR”, “short version” | Claude |
| RAG-style Search | “docs”, “fetch info”, “lookup” | Command R+, GPT-3.5 |

---

## 🧠 Step 3: Make the Decision – Route It

Now that we’ve identified:

- What kind of task this is
- What models are good at it
- What they cost

…it’s time to **choose**.

You’ll write a small function like:

```python
def route_query(query):
    intent = detect_intent(query)
    suitable_models = get_models_by_capability(intent)
    return select_cheapest_model(suitable_models)

```

You can even use a **scoring formula** like:

```
score = (capability_match * 0.6) + (cost_efficiency * 0.4)

```

This way, you strike a balance between quality and expense.

---

## 🖥️ Step 4: Run It in the Terminal

The fun part? This is all **terminal-based**.

You can build a simple CLI tool where:

- The user types a query
- The router shows which model was chosen
- The answer is printed in real time

Example flow:

```
$ python router.py
🤖 Ask me anything: How do I center a div in CSS?

🧭 Routing to: Mistral 7B (low-cost, HTML capable)
💬 Response: Use `display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;`

```

## 🛠️ Advanced Features to Try (Optional But Cool)

- 🧮 **Model usage tracker**
    
    → Show how often each model is used and how much it cost in total.
    
- 🕹️ **User override**
    
    → Let users type: `!gpt` to force GPT usage.
    
- 🧪 **A/B testing**
    
    → Run the same query through two models and compare.
    
- 🔄 **Fallback mechanism**
    
    → If a model fails, try the next best one.

## 💡 Real-World Use Cases

This router idea isn’t just for projects — it’s startup material.

🧑‍💻 **Startup teams** use it to balance costs while building smart assistants.

📚 **EdTech apps** use cheaper models for MCQ generation, and smarter ones for essay feedback.

🤖 **Chatbots** use it to switch tone or depth depending on the query.

Anywhere LLMs are used, **routing** brings optimization.

## 🧾 Conclusion – Build Smarter, Spend Smarter

So what did we build in this project?

- A **multi-model routing system** that connects queries with the **right LLM**.
- We balanced **skill vs cost**, using **intent detection + metadata scoring**.
- The whole thing works from your **terminal**, just like a coding Swiss Army knife.

> Final tip? Start simple. Add two models first. Once it works, plug in more, track results, and improve your decision logic.
