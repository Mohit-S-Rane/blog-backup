SEO stands for **Search Engine Optimization**.

It’s the art (and science) of:

- Making your site understandable to search engines like Google
- Ensuring your content is relevant to user searches
- Boosting your visibility so people **actually find** your website

> Think of SEO as telling Google:
> 
> 
> “Hey! Here’s what my page is about. Please recommend it to the right people.”
> 

And here’s the kicker:

**SEO isn't just about keywords.** It’s also about performance, accessibility, structure, and experience.

## 💨 Web Performance Optimization Basics

### 1. **Use a Performance Budget**

Decide on a max size for your page (e.g., < 200KB initial load).

Don’t let your JavaScript and images grow unchecked.

### 2. **Minimize JavaScript & CSS**

- Use tools like **Terser** or **esbuild** for JS
- Tree-shake unused code
- Avoid giant frameworks for small tasks

### 3. **Image Optimization**

- Use **WebP or AVIF** formats
- Compress images (TinyPNG, Squoosh)
- Set width/height to avoid layout shifts

### 4. **Lazy Loading**

Only load images or components **when needed**.

Use `loading="lazy"` on `<img>` tags.

### 5. **Use a CDN**

Deliver static files from servers **close to users**.

Try: Cloudflare, Vercel, Netlify, Fastly

### 6. **Defer Non-Critical JS**

Use `defer` or `async` to load scripts *after* the main content.

## 🧠 Core Web Vitals (Google Cares About These!)

| Metric | Target | What It Means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) | < 2.5s | Time to load main visible content |
| FID (First Input Delay) | < 100ms | Time before the page responds to user input |
| CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) | < 0.1 | Prevent janky page shifts |

Use tools like:

- [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/)
- [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/)
- [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/)
- [GTmetrix](https://gtmetrix.com/)

## 🧭 Quick SEO Checklist (for Developers)

### 📄 HTML Meta Tags

- `<title>`: Unique per page
- `<meta name="description">`: 150–160 characters
- `<meta name="robots" content="index, follow">`

### 🖼️ Images

- Add meaningful `alt` text
- Avoid “image123.jpg”—use “product-name.webp”
- Serve responsive images (`<picture>` + `srcset`)

### 📁 URLs

- Use **hyphens**, not underscores
- Avoid query strings for core pages
- Example: `/blog/seo-basics` instead of `/page?id=42`

### 🧭 Sitemap & Robots.txt

- Generate a sitemap.xml (use [sitemap-generator-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sitemap-generator))
- Use robots.txt to control crawler access

### 🔗 Links

- Internal links should be **semantic and descriptive**
- Don’t write “click here”—write “learn more about SEO basics”

---

## 📊 Use Structured Data (Schema.org)

Structured data helps Google **understand your content better** and can enable **rich results**.

### Example:

```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Article",
  "headline": "SEO Basics & Performance Optimization",
  "author": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Your Name"
  },
  "datePublished": "2025-06-15"
}
</script>

```

Use Google’s [Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results) to check your markup.
