# Git Internals: What Actually Happens When You Push Code?

Have you ever wondered what’s happening **behind the scenes** when you run `git push`? To many of us, Git can feel like a mysterious black box—magically transporting our code to the remote repository. But understanding what’s going on under the hood is essential, whether you’re a **college student preparing for interviews**, a **developer ensuring smooth collaboration**, or an **executive overseeing software delivery**.

In this article, we’ll break down Git’s internals step by step, so you’ll know exactly **what happens when you push code**—no more guesswork!

## Introduction: Why Should You Care?

Imagine your codebase is a treasure chest, and `git push` is the key that delivers your gems to the rest of your team (or even production!). But without knowing how that key works, you’re missing out on crucial insights:

✅ **Troubleshoot issues faster** when pushes fail.

✅ **Understand performance bottlenecks** for large projects.

✅ **Build confidence** in how collaboration works at a fundamental level.

## 1️⃣ A Quick Refresher: What is a Git Repository?

Before we dive into pushing code, let’s quickly review some core Git concepts:

🔹 **Repository (repo):** A database that stores snapshots of your project’s files.

🔹 **Local Repository:** Exists on your computer.

🔹 **Remote Repository:** Usually on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

✅ **Tip:** Think of your local repo as your personal workspace and the remote repo as the team’s shared workspace.

## 2️⃣ The Journey Begins: Staging and Committing

Before pushing code, you typically:

1. **Stage changes** using `git add`:
    
    ```bash
    git add file1.js
    
    ```
    
    This tells Git: “I’m ready to commit these changes.”
    
2. **Commit changes** using `git commit`:
    
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Add new feature"
    
    ```
    
    This creates a snapshot in your local repository—like saving a checkpoint in a video game.
    

📌 **Key Point:** At this stage, your changes are still local—nobody else can see them yet!

## 3️⃣ What Actually Happens During `git push`?

Here’s where the magic happens! Let’s break down what happens when you run:

```bash
git push origin main

```

🛤️ **Step 1: Identify What Needs to Be Pushed**

- Git compares your local branch (`main`) with the remote branch (`origin/main`).
- It figures out which commits exist in your local repo but **not yet** in the remote.

🛤️ **Step 2: Create a Packfile**

- Git compresses your commits and associated data (like blobs, trees, and commits) into a **packfile**—a compact, efficient format for data transfer.
- Think of a packfile as a **zip file** for your project’s history.

🛤️ **Step 3: Authenticate and Connect**

- Git connects to the remote repository over HTTPS or SSH.
- You authenticate with a username/password or SSH key.
- ✅ **Tip:** SSH keys are preferred for secure, hassle-free authentication.

🛤️ **Step 4: Send Data to Remote**

- The packfile is sent to the remote repository.
- The remote unpacks the data and updates its database.

🛤️ **Step 5: Update Remote References**

- The remote branch pointer (`origin/main`) is updated to include the new commits.
- This means your teammates can now pull the latest code.

## 4️⃣ Visual Summary

Here’s a **simplified flowchart** of what happens during a push:

```
[ Local Repository ]
    ⬇ (git add)
[ Staging Area ]
    ⬇ (git commit)
[ Local Branch ]
    ⬇ (git push)
[ Compare local with remote ]
    ⬇
[ Create packfile ]
    ⬇
[ Authenticate & connect ]
    ⬇
[ Send packfile ]
    ⬇
[ Remote updates branch pointer ]

```

## 5️⃣ Real-World Example: A Team Project

Let’s say Alice is working on the `feature-login` branch. She’s finished her work, so she:

- Stages and commits her changes locally.
- Runs `git push origin feature-login`.

Behind the scenes:

- Git creates a packfile with Alice’s changes.
- Alice’s SSH key authenticates her.
- GitHub unpacks the data and updates the `feature-login` branch.

Now Bob can pull Alice’s branch and review her changes—no confusion, no overwriting, and no stress!

## 6️⃣ Common Issues (and How to Fix Them)

🔴 **Push Rejected: Non-Fast-Forward**

- Happens when someone else pushed changes before you.
- Solution:
    
    ```bash
    git pull --rebase
    git push
    
    ```
    
- This replays your commits on top of the latest remote branch.

🔴 **Authentication Errors**

- Happens if SSH keys or credentials aren’t set up properly.
- Solution:
    - Check your SSH keys: `ssh-add -l`
    - Verify remote URL: `git remote -v`

## Why This Matters to You

✅ **College Students:**

Knowing how `git push` works gives you confidence in interviews and real-world projects.

✅ **Corporate Developers:**

Troubleshoot issues faster, collaborate more effectively, and impress teammates with your Git knowledge.

✅ **Executives and Managers:**

Understanding Git’s internals helps you appreciate your team’s workflows and design better collaboration processes.

## Conclusion: Take Control of Your Pushes

Next time you run `git push`, remember: it’s not just a command—it’s a carefully orchestrated sequence of **identifying changes, compressing data, authenticating, and updating the remote**.

📌 **Action Step:**

- Try creating a small test project.
- Make a change, commit it, and run `git push`.
- Observe what happens using `git log`, `git status`, and `git reflog`.

With these insights, you’ll never look at `git push` the same way again. 🚀
