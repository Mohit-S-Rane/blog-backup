# 🛠️ DevOps Portfolio Projects to Showcase: From Shell Scripts to Full Pipelines

*Because “I know Docker” on your resume means nothing without proof.*

## 🎯 Why a DevOps Portfolio Matters

Let’s be real: DevOps isn’t a “just trust me” role.

Whether you're applying as a release engineer, SRE, or cloud platform specialist—**recruiters and hiring managers want evidence.**

Evidence that:

- You understand CI/CD
- You can write infra-as-code
- You’ve broken things and fixed them
- You know how systems behave in production

> 💡 Pro Tip: A solid DevOps portfolio is like your GitHub-powered resume—with working code, real projects, and deployable infra.
> 

So let’s explore **7 powerful DevOps project ideas**, along with:

- What you’ll learn
- Tech stacks to use
- Bonus tips to impress

## 💡 1. Dockerize a Fullstack App

**Goal:** Show you can containerize and isolate applications

### What to Build:

Take a simple fullstack app (Node + React, Django + Vue, etc.) and:

- Write a `Dockerfile` for both frontend and backend
- Use Docker Compose to run them together
- Add a volume for persistent database (Postgres, MySQL)

### What You'll Learn:

- Writing clean `Dockerfile`s
- Using multistage builds for smaller images
- Managing services with `docker-compose`
- Networking containers

### Bonus:

Add a `.env` file and explain how to avoid hardcoding secrets.

Put the whole thing on GitHub with a “1-click deploy” section in the README.

---

## 🔄 2. Build a CI/CD Pipeline from Scratch

**Goal:** Automate code testing, building, and deployment

### What to Build:

Pick a repo (your own or forked) and:

- Set up GitHub Actions / GitLab CI
- Run unit tests on every push
- Build Docker image and push to Docker Hub
- Deploy to staging via SSH, Kubernetes, or Render

### What You'll Learn:

- Writing pipeline configs (`.yml` files)
- Automating builds and tests
- Secure secrets via CI
- Deployment strategies

### Bonus:

Add Slack notifications or Telegram alerts when a deployment succeeds/fails.

---

## ☁️ 3. Deploy a Kubernetes Cluster (Mini or Cloud)

**Goal:** Prove you understand container orchestration

### What to Build:

- Start with Minikube or Kind (local)
- Or use cloud (GKE, EKS, DigitalOcean)
- Deploy 2 services + ingress controller
- Use Helm to package your app

### What You'll Learn:

- Writing `Deployment`, `Service`, and `Ingress` YAML
- Managing secrets and config maps
- Scaling pods, rolling updates
- Using Helm charts

### Bonus:

Add HPA (horizontal pod autoscaler) and simulate load with `k6` or `hey`.

---

## 📦 4. Infra as Code with Terraform

**Goal:** Show you can provision cloud resources cleanly

### What to Build:

- Deploy an EC2 instance, S3 bucket, and RDS database
- Use Terraform modules to structure your code
- Use remote state with locking (S3 + DynamoDB)

### What You'll Learn:

- Writing Terraform syntax (`.tf` files)
- Managing state
- Handling variable files and outputs
- Reusability with modules

### Bonus:

Create a GitHub repo with a simple “one command deploy” script for users.

---

## 🔍 5. Monitoring and Alerting Stack

**Goal:** Demonstrate observability best practices

### What to Build:

- Use Prometheus + Grafana for metrics
- Loki or ELK for logs
- Export metrics from an app (e.g., HTTP requests, memory)

### What You'll Learn:

- Setting up Prometheus exporters
- Creating dashboards in Grafana
- Writing PromQL queries
- Setting alerts based on thresholds

### Bonus:

Simulate a failing service and demonstrate alert triggering via email or webhook.

---

## 🔐 6. Secrets Management Demo

**Goal:** Show you understand security in production

### What to Build:

- Use HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager
- Build a small app that fetches secrets at runtime
- Rotate secrets and demonstrate secure access

### What You'll Learn:

- Secure secret storage
- App integration (env vars or dynamic credentials)
- Policies and access control

### Bonus:

Write a short guide on “Don’t store secrets in Git” and publish it with your repo.

---

## 🧪 7. Chaos Engineering Lab

**Goal:** Exhibit your focus on reliability and resilience

### What to Build:

- Use tools like Chaos Mesh or Gremlin (or `kill` manually 😄)
- Inject latency, shutdown services
- Monitor app behavior under stress
- Recover automatically

### What You'll Learn:

- Concepts like graceful degradation
- Alert tuning and fallback strategies
- Writing postmortems and failure scenarios

### Bonus:

Record a screen demo showing “failure injection” and recovery. Add this to your LinkedIn or portfolio website.

## 📁 Organizing Your DevOps Portfolio

Here’s how to make your portfolio **shine**:

| Section | Tips |
| --- | --- |
| **Project README** | Clear overview, tech stack, setup steps, diagrams |
| **GitHub Repos** | Clean commits, modular structure, no secrets |
| **Blog Posts** | Write about what you built + the lessons learned |
| **Live Demo** | Deploy on Vercel, Netlify, Render, or Fly.io |
| **LinkedIn/GitHub** | Pin top projects, add badges, share learnings |

---

## ✅ TL;DR: Portfolio Checklist

✔️ Dockerized app with `docker-compose`

✔️ CI/CD pipeline with automated testing and deployment

✔️ Kubernetes deployment with Helm

✔️ Terraform-managed infrastructure

✔️ Monitoring stack (Prometheus + Grafana)

✔️ Secrets management example

✔️ Bonus: Chaos engineering demo

## 🎯 Final Thoughts

The best way to stand out in DevOps isn’t to claim you “know tools.”

It’s to **show how you use them**, how you think through problems, and how you recover from failure.

> Great portfolios tell stories:
> 
> 
> “Here’s what I built. Here’s how it works. Here’s what I learned.”
> 

You don’t need 10 projects.

You just need 2–3 that are **complete**, **well-documented**, and **reflect real-world problems**.
